# MuseumDB
Design and implementation of a Museum database

Topic Description:
o	The main business process is collecting antiquities, and historic art pieces. The database is designed to contain all the possible gathered information about each piece in the museum.

o	The most important data is the date that each piece belongs to and to whom it may have belonged as well (owner), and the size of it.

o	The museum managers will be handling these data, importing them to the system, and checking that everything is right and in its place.

o	The causalities and constraints between the data is that the owner of such antiquity, created or ordered for such thing to be created for different purposes, depends on the time of creation and on the need of such creation.
